WebGL is not directly supported by Netcode, so if you try building to WebGL the networking features will not work.
The issue is that the Transport Layer (Unity Transport) uses UDP sockets and UDP isn't supported by WebGL.
There is non-official solution to this and it is to replace the transport layer with Websocket transport, which uses TCP.
Please note that TCP will be slower and less performant than UDP.
Survival Engine does not edit any of the transport layer so there should be no issues, however this has not been tested yet.
