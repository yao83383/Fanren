Integration with Dialogue and Quests
1) Import Survival Engine first
2) Import Dialogue and Quests
3) If there are no compile errors, the Scripting Define Symbol DIALOGUE_QUESTS should be added automatically to the player settings. If not, add it manually. 
4) Inside DialogueQuests/Upgrades, import the package SEOnline to upgrade DQ to have online features
5) Make sure the DQManager prefab is in the scene, and that you add the Actor script to all the PlayerCharacter prefabs.
6) Open the demo scene in the DialogueQuests/DemoSE folder and try it!

Integration with Map and Minimap:
1) Import Survival Engine first
2) Import Map and Minimaps
3) If there are no compile errors, the "Scripting Define Symbol" MAP_MINIMAP should be added automatically to the player settings. If not add it manually. 
4) Make sure the MapManager prefab is in the scene, and that you add the MapIcon script to the PlayerCharacter (Set its type to "Player").
5) Add a MapZone to your scene, and setup the zone to contain the map area, then use MapCapture to generate a template map sprite.
6) Add the MapLevelSettings script to your scene, and set it's properties. Then everything should work!

Integration with the New Input System
1) Import Survival Engine
2) Install Unity Input System in the package manager
3) Import the NewInputSystem package, it is in the Upgrades folder
4) In BuildSettings->PlayerSettings, set the Active Input Handling to Both
5) Open the Managers prefab (SurvivalEngine/Prefabs), click on EventSystem, and click on Replace with InputSystemUIInputModule
6) On the same component, set the Pointer Behavior to: Single Unified Pointer.
7) If you want to enable gamepads: Open the Managers prefabs (SurvivalEngine/Prefabs), and on PlayerControls, set to true the variable: gamepad_controls

Convert the project to URP (or HDRP)
1) Import Survival Engine
2) Install the Universal RP in Unity package manager
3) In Project Files, right click -> Create -> Rendering -> URP -> Pipeline Asset
4) In Edit->ProjectSettings, under Graphics tab, drag the new files created into Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings
5) This will turn all your materials pink, you need to convert them to URP materials now
6) Go in Edit->Render Pipeline->URP-> Upgrade project materials to URP
7) A few decorative elements may not work in URP (like the grass shader), but these do not affect the gameplay and usability of the engine. You can hide those or replace their materials.
8) All scripts, models, anims and UI in this engine should work with any Render Pipeline without issues.
9) If you see anything that is not working properly in URP or HDRP, please contact me by email/discord.
